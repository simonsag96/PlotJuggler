## ✅ Fixed

### Plugin bugs — CSV (8 / 8)

| # | Title | Evidence |
|---|---|---|
| #850 | More than one header line in CSV | `07451d6e`, `bd318377` |
| #987 | Load a directory tree with CSV files | `2d57c875` |
| #1000 | Load CSVs from CLI without prefix | `c91ccda5` |
| #1068 | Select filename on export | `toolbox_ui.cpp:151` (`QFileDialog::getSaveFileName`) |
| #1290 | CSV export missing quaternion/RPY values | ToolboxCSV iterates full `_plot_data->numeric` — probably fixed; manual smoke test recommended |
| #1137 | Quaternion/RPY not exported (duplicate of #1290) | same as #1290 |
| #1018 | Exporting strings to CSV doesn't work | `44118575` (cherry-pick of `ee91bbc1 Feature: StringsSeries allowed (#1337)`) — `toolbox_csv.cpp` reads `_plot_data->strings` in 8 places |
| #662 | Multi-file prefix: can't add prefix to individually-added files | `c91ccda5` — `--auto-prefix` CLI flag auto-assigns each file's basename as its prefix (commit message cites #1000 only; scope extends to #662) |

### Core app (12 / 32)

| # | Title | Commit |
|---|---|---|
| #749 | Multi-file prefix dialog buttons inaccessible | `b827b3e7` |
| #464 | `-l` + `-d` flag data not reloaded | `abb6a866` |
| #1052 | Plot Docker toolbar "X" segfault | `ef5495f0` |
| #1062 | Build fails on clang ≥ 19 | `57fa83a6` |
| #1080 | Vertical zoom stuck on max 0.1 | `e4ee6288` |
| #967 | `--buffer_size` not applied on Ubuntu 20.04 | `8317c42c` |
| #528 | Time Cursor Limits not updated with Time Offset | `8317c42c` |
| #1291 | Time starts at 01:00:00.0 on time offset | `c0707de5` |
| #1014 | Layout XML attribute order not deterministic | `c3c33c28` |
| #1326 | Fields with colons misinterpreted as time | `6806a320` |
| #1151 | Colormap not saved in layout XML | `19d06903` |
| #994 | Buffer value not saved in layout | `09d7f6b9` |

### Plugin bugs — MCAP (5 / 5 — category complete)

| # | Title | Evidence |
|---|---|---|
| #1133 | Error opening bag files since update to latest version | Likely fixed by `92b862b4` ("much faster MCAP pre-loading and update to 2.1.2", Feb 2026) or subsequent MCAP lib work. **Manually verified on 2026-04-20**. Single-file verification — revisit if other users re-report with different file variants. |
| #783 | Cannot open mcap bags | **Manually verified on 2026-04-20** against a previously failing file. No explicit `Fix #783` commit; same MCAP-loader improvements as #1133 likely cover the original report. Generic bug description — if re-reported with a different file, may surface a distinct root cause. |
| #754 | Error reading the mcap file | **Manually verified on 2026-04-20** — effectively duplicate of #783; same caveat applies. Worth noting on GitHub as "closed; duplicate of #783" rather than as an independent fix. |
| #958 | MCAP file created on Linux won't open on Windows | **Manually verified on 2026-04-20** against a Linux-created MCAP file opened on Windows. No explicit `Fix #958` commit; the same MCAP-loader improvements (`92b862b4`, `bc71a2ff`, `c3e443a0`) that fixed #1133/#783/#754 likely cover this case too. Single-environment verification — revisit if re-reported with specific file variants (non-ASCII paths, Zstd-compressed, unfinalized summary). |
| #903 | Floating point truncated exception on INT64 fields | **Fixed upstream on 2024-01-29** by `81e0e920` (`fix issue #929 : numerical truncation`) + `dcbc8c6b` (`bypass truncation check`). Actual owner is `ParserROS`, not `DataLoadMCAP` — root throw at `plotjuggler_plugins/ParserROS/rosx_introspection/include/rosx_introspection/details/conversion_impl.hpp:209,314,334`; runtime opt-out wired in `ros_parser.cpp:148-161`. User-facing workaround: **App → Preferences → Behavior → Parsing → "Strict Truncation check (uncheck at your own risk)"**. Error message (`ros_parser.cpp:169-173`) guides users to this toggle. GitHub issue is still open only because the fix commit cited #929 instead of #903 — administrative close recommended (e.g. as duplicate of #929). |

### Plugin bugs — Lua / Scripting (4 / 4 — category complete)

| # | Title | Evidence |
|---|---|---|
| #1328 | Fails to build with Lua 5.5 | `5d3e232b` — hand-port of sol2 PR #1723 into the bundled single-header `3rdparty/sol2-3.5.0/include/sol/sol.hpp` (widens unsupported-version guard to accept 5.5, extends `LUA_ERRGCMM` shim to Lua ≥ 5.4, wraps `lua_newstate` for the 3-arg 5.5 signature). Regression-checked against Lua 5.1 (minimal sol2 program compiles and runs); real 5.5 build not verified locally (Lua 5.5 not installed on this machine — worth a real build once available). |
| #1312 | New Lua version breaks `quat_to_yaw` / `quat_to_roll` | `ae78a30b` — `default.snippets.xml`: PR #1164 had swapped `math.atan(y, x)` for `math.atan2(y, x)` to support Lua 5.1/5.2, but `math.atan2` was removed in Lua 5.4, so the snippets broke on the default bundled 5.4.7. Fix adds `local atan2 = math.atan2 or math.atan` at the top of both snippets so the correct name is picked at load time across Lua 5.1–5.5. `quat_to_pitch` uses `math.asin` and was unaffected. |
| #968 | Misalignment in time series due to differing sizes with reactive scripts | `8d9c2afb` — `reactive_function.{h,cpp}`: `TimeseriesRef::atTime(t)` silently returns the clamped endpoint value when `t` falls outside the series' recorded range (because `getIndexFromX` in `timeseries.h:152-175` clamps to `size()-1`/`0`). Feb 2026 storage refactor (`48497feb`, `9493434e`) did not change that semantics. Fix exposes `getIndexAtTime(t)` on `TimeseriesRef` so reactive-script Lua (the ToolboxLuaEditor / `ReactiveLuaFunction` context) can compare the retrieved sample's `x` against the query time and detect out-of-range clamping. **Scope note**: applies only to reactive scripts, **not** to Lua custom functions (`LuaCustomFunction` has its own `_lua_engine` with no `TimeseriesRef` binding; its scripts receive pre-computed positional args from the C++ host and share the same clamping bug at `python_custom_function.cpp:483,490` and the equivalent in `lua_custom_function.cpp`). Fixing that second surface requires a host-level range check — deliberately out of scope here since no user has reported it. Purely additive; matches `firemark`'s suggestion on the closed PR #969. Fork-only for now (not sent upstream). |
| #800 | Crash caused by reactive script errors | `bdf39ec9` — `reactive_function.{h,cpp}`: `ReactiveLuaFunction::calculate()` showed a modal `QMessageBox::warning` for every failure (line present and untouched since 2022-07-25, `af4f9d115`); under streaming sources (UDP 20-100 Hz) a script that errors every tick piled dialogs faster than the user could dismiss them, exhausting Qt USER32 handles on Windows and crashing PJ. Fix adds a `_disabled_after_error` flag set **before** the modal `QMessageBox::warning` is shown (so re-entrant streaming timer firings during the nested modal event loop see the flag and short-circuit, instead of queueing more dialogs). Script is auto re-enabled on save via the existing editor lifecycle (`lua_editor.cpp:271` constructs a fresh `ReactiveLuaFunction` on every save — new instance → default flag), so no explicit resume API was needed. Scope: reactive scripts only; CustomFunction streaming-path errors go to stderr via `qWarning`, no dialog, no parallel spam pathology. |

### Plugin bugs — ZMQ (2 / 3)

| # | Title | Evidence |
|---|---|---|
| #705 | ZeroMQ Subscriber filter | **COMPLETED — fixed upstream by PR #730 (`db90f70a ZMQ: Add topics filtering`, merged 2022-12-18).** Already on `plugin_issues` (and `main`). Adds semicolon/comma/whitespace-separated topic-filter parsing in `datastream_zmq.cpp:355-372` (`parseTopicFilters`), plus a test publisher at `plotjuggler_plugins/DataStreamZMQ/utilities/start_test_publisher.py`. Safe administrative close — Davide merged this himself. |
| #941 | Extraneous suffixes added to ZMQ IPC endpoints | **COMPLETED** — `752e1773` *"datastream_zmq: drop bogus `:port` suffix on ipc:// endpoints"*. The socket-address assembly at `datastream_zmq.cpp:153` always concatenated `<protocol><address>:<port>`, which is correct for `tcp://` but corrupted `ipc://` endpoints (IPC uses filesystem paths, no port). Fix guards the `:port` suffix on protocol and disables the port field in the dialog when `ipc://` is selected so the user can't enter a value that would be silently ignored. **Manually verified on 2026-04-21** with a pyzmq PUB on both `tcp://*:9872` and `ipc:///tmp/pj_zmq_test` against PlotJuggler's ZMQ Subscriber — both paths plot as expected; IPC case no longer appends `:9872`. Two sibling bugs are intentionally left in-tree (separate tickets if re-reported): `radioBind` toggle forces `"0.0.0.0"` (TCP-specific), and the default stored address is `"localhost"` (also TCP-centric). Fork-only for now (not yet sent upstream). |

### Plugin bugs — UDP (1 / 1 — administrative close, not worth fixing)

| # | Title | Evidence |
|---|---|---|
| #839 | UDP JSON stream timestamp setting not saved with layout | **Administrative close — no code. No sense fixing it in isolation.** The reported symptom is one face of a design shared by all five "simple" streamers (`DataStreamUDP`, `DataStreamMQTT`, `DataStreamZMQ`, `DataStreamWebsocket`, `DataStreamSerialPort`): none override `xmlSaveState` / `xmlLoadState`, all rely on `QSettings` for cross-run memory. The complex bridges (`DataStreamFoxgloveBridge`, `DataStreamPlotJugglerBridge`, `PluginsZcm`) and every DataLoader (Parquet, CSV, ULog, MCAP, Zcm) *do* persist state to the layout XML. Fixing UDP alone would desync one plugin from its four siblings without solving the reporter's underlying workflow; broadening to all five is refactor scope out-of-bounds for a single ticket. Reopen if the reporter describes a concrete use-case that `QSettings` defaults cannot satisfy, or if layout-persistence is rebuilt as a base-class feature on `PJ::DataStreamer`. |

### Plugin bugs — Parquet (2 / 2 — category complete)

| # | Title | Evidence |
|---|---|---|
| #863 | Parquet file with BYTE_ARRAY / TIMESTAMP_MILLIS columns fails to load | `4080e0eb` — `dataload_parquet.cpp`: split the old numeric-only whitelist (lines 253-259) into `is_numeric` + `is_string`, and routed `arrow::Type::STRING` / `LARGE_STRING` / `BINARY` columns to `PlotDataMapRef::getOrCreateStringSeries()` — mirroring the CSV pattern from commit `44118575` *"Feature: StringsSeries allowed"*. `ColumnInfo` now carries both `PlotData*` and `StringSeries*` (exactly one set per column); the per-row batch loop dispatches on whichever is populated. `arrow::StringArray` / `LargeStringArray` / `BinaryArray` all share `GetView(int64_t) → std::string_view`, which constructs `PJ::StringRef` directly; `StringSeries::pushBack` (`stringseries.h:56-65`) does the interning. String columns are deliberately **not** offered as timestamp-axis candidates. The *TIMESTAMP_MILLIS* half of the ticket was already fixed by `900557e0` (Feb 2026, *"parquet_loading: fix timestamp handling for arrow::TIMESTAMP"*). **Manually verified on 2026-04-21** with a pyarrow fixture containing `timestamp (ms)` + `temperature (double)` + `label (string)` + `status (binary)` columns: all four appeared in the Timeseries list, the 5-second X-axis matched 50 × 100 ms, and a Python Custom Function reading `value == "ok"` produced the expected square wave — proving strings actually land in `_plot_data->strings` and are consumable by the scripting layer. **Scope caveats**: `FIXED_SIZE_BINARY` not added (less common, would need a separate `FixedSizeBinaryArray` branch). Not tested on very large files or on chunked-string arrays. |
| #862 | Building DataLoadParquet on Windows | **Administrative close — no code change in this repo.** Commit `00b94253` *"add Arrow to conan and fix Windows CI (#1109)"* already added Conan to the Parquet plugin build, and `plotjuggler_plugins/DataLoadParquet/cmake/FindArrow.cmake:35-62` covers MSVC toolchain detection, `_static` suffix handling, `.dll` lookup, and import-lib (`.lib`) resolution. **Not independently verified on Windows** (no MSVC environment on Álvaro's machine). Revisit if re-reported with specific MSVC / vcpkg / mingw / Qt version repro steps — the current close rests on evidence of prior work, not on a live Windows build. |

### Feature requests — addressed indirectly (2 / 51)

| # | Title | Evidence |
|---|---|---|
| #1323 | Python scripting + StringSeries support + UI improvements to Custom Functions | `c04e376e`, `ee91bbc1`, `ea9635e6`, `29f8b6cb` |
| #1220 | Option for dates & times stored in separate columns | `8d1346c3` (upstream PR #1259) |

## Next up — Parquet plugin complete

Plugin-category progress: `#863` by the new BYTE_ARRAY → StringSeries path in `dataload_parquet.cpp` (plus the earlier `900557e0` TIMESTAMP fix), `#862` by administrative close citing commit `00b94253`'s Conan/Arrow Windows CI work, `#839` (UDP layout-persistence) closed administratively as systemic-not-UDP-specific, `#705` (ZMQ topic filter) closed administratively via upstream PR #730 / `db90f70a`, and `#941` (ZMQ IPC `:port` suffix) fixed by `752e1773`. Four plugin categories fully closed — **CSV (8/8)**, **MCAP (5/5)**, **Lua (4/4)**, **Parquet (2/2)** — plus UDP (1/1 administrative) and ZMQ (2/3 — only `#1126` Protobuf-paths left). **22 plugin issues closed of 49 total.**

Remaining plugin categories (27 waiting): ROS/ROS2 (18), MQTT (3), ULog (2), ZMQ (1), Protobuf / FFT / Quaternion (1 each).

### Suggested next target
- **#537** (ROS/ROS2, rosout dark-theme invisible debug messages): tiniest scope, pure stylesheet. Good warm-up.
- **#741** (ToolboxFFT Y-scaling): bounded inside one toolbox.
- **#991** (DataLoad ROS bags `map::at`): probably a missing `.count()` guard.
- **ROS/ROS2 clustering pass**: `#477 / #759 / #860` all in the ROS2 Re-Publisher, `#1204 / #1262` about ROS2 Header quirks — duplicates inside those clusters may drop the effective count to ~14.
- **ULog (2)**: `#672` (2.5 GB file) + `#796` (PX4 improvements meta-ticket). Upstream has an experimental rewrite on `test/ulog-parser-unit-tests` (`bde0ede5`, `DataLoadULog2` using `ulog_cpp`) that would likely close both — but it's not merged. Watch-and-wait.

---

## Caveats

- **"Fixed" here means** a commit in history claims to fix the issue, or code review shows the capability is present. Not independently verified against the live GitHub tracker.
- **#1290 / #1137** (CSV export of quaternion/RPY) should get a manual smoke test before being closed on GitHub: load MCAP with IMU → ToolboxQuaternion → export RPY → inspect the resulting CSV.
- **#662** (multi-file prefix on individually-added files) is marked fixed because `--auto-prefix` covers the CLI workflow; the underlying GUI flow where files are added one-by-one via `+` is unchanged. Revisit if the issue is re-reported with GUI-specific repro steps.
- **#1337** is a PR number (not in the 156-issue list); it closes issue #1018.
- Several merged upstream commits fix PRs/issues **not in the 156-issue snapshot** and are therefore not counted: `#1015`, `#1065`, `#1254`, `#1277`, `#1278`, `#1279`, `#1281`, `#1282`, `#1285`, `#1287`, `#1289`, `#1295`, `#1296`, `#1297`, `#1298`, `#1300`, `#1301`, `#1306`, `#1310`, `#1314`, `#1324`.
